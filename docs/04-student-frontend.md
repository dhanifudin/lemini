# Student Personalized Learning Hub Plan

This document outlines the planned web front-end for students engaging with the personalized biology learning experience seeded by `BiologyDemoSeeder`. The design emphasizes clarity, adaptive guidance, and actionable feedback so learners can quickly understand their standing and next steps.

## 1. Goals
- Present a holistic overview of a student's progress across biology objectives.
- Surface feedback and mastery insights generated by the adaptive engine.
- Provide clear pathways to follow-up resources and practice items.
- Encourage reflection and iteration by visualizing growth over time.

## 2. Tech Stack & Architecture
- **Framework**: Inertia.js with Vue 3 (aligns with Filament/Laravel backend).
- **Routing**: Laravel routes returning Inertia pages (`/dashboard`, `/feedback`, `/practice`, `/profile`).
- **State Management**: Pinia store to cache user profile, mastery data, and recommendations.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Filament-inspired UI kit for consistency.
- **Data Fetching**: Authorized JSON endpoints (`/api/mastery`, `/api/recommendations`, `/api/practice-items`) consumed by the Inertia pages.
- **Authentication**: Fortify/Jetstream session-based auth; require `role = student`.

## 3. Top-Level Pages

### 3.1 Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- Summary cards: current mastery level per objective (progress bar + level text).
- Highlighted recommendation: next best action with CTA buttons.
- Activity timeline: recent attempts and feedback release events (chronological).
- Quick links to new practice sets or lab reflections.

### 3.2 Feedback Center (`/feedback`)
- Tabbed interface:
  - `Published` feedback: cards with AI summary, teacher notes, action steps.
  - `Draft` feedback: notifications that additional review is pending.
- Detail drawer when selecting an attempt to show the original response, rubric breakdown, and score history.
- Acknowledge/Reflect button prompting students to log takeaways (stores note via API).

### 3.3 Practice & Resources (`/practice`)
- Personalized practice queue generated from recommendations and mastery gaps.
- Item cards indicating objective, difficulty, and estimated time.
- Launch actions:
  - `Practice now` opens item viewer (MCQ/SAQ rendering).
  - `Preview rubric` modal to remind expectations.
- Supplemental resources list referencing curated biology videos, simulations, and readings.

### 3.4 Profile & Settings (`/profile`)
- Basic info (name, email, avatar placeholder), read-only role.
- Notification preferences for feedback releases.
- Progress export button (PDF or CSV) for parent/teacher sharing.

## 4. Reusable Components
- `MasteryProgressCard` (props: objectiveCode, level, progressPercent).
- `RecommendationHighlight` (props: payload, primaryAction).
- `FeedbackCard` (props: status, aiSummary, actionSteps, teacherNote).
- `AttemptDrawer` (props: attempt, feedback).
- `PracticeItemCard` (props: item summary, rubric details).
- `ReflectionModal` (props: attemptId, onSubmit handler).

## 5. Data Flow
1. On login, `/dashboard` requests aggregated data (`/api/dashboard`) containing mastery summary, featured recommendation, and activity log.
2. Subsequent navigation reuses store data; background refresh triggers when stale (5 min TTL).
3. User interactions (acknowledging feedback, launching practice) post to endpoints with optimistic UI updates.
4. Error handling:
   - Network hiccup: show toast + retry link.
   - Auth failure: redirect to login.
   - Missing data: empty state illustrations encouraging user action.

## 6. Accessibility & UX Considerations
- Use semantic HTML and aria-labels for screen readers.
- Ensure color contrast passes WCAG AA (particularly mastery progress bars).
- Keyboard navigation for tabbed feedback interface and modals.
- Provide copywritten guidance to contextualize AI feedback in human-friendly language.

## 7. Future Enhancements
- Integrate goal-setting widgets allowing students to schedule study reminders.
- Add social features like peer discussion threads tied to specific objectives.
- Implement analytics on resource effectiveness to adapt recommendations dynamically.
